Corrugated cardboard is also strucutrally anisotropic so you should be following some specific building techniques mentioned in th ecoroplast video. Cardboard is also not very strong or ware resistant so it should be laminated by cellotape to add to its strength as well as water resistance.</span></li></ol><p class="c6"><span class="c1">You can use other kinds of 5 mm thick foam/material if they are light enough to keep the total weight of the plane low enough that it can take off given the thrust of you motor and lift of it&rsquo;s wings. You can compare it with the density of flight board pro material and make sure that it not more than 2 times the density of flight board pro.</span></p><p class="c9"><span class="c1">Glues/Adhesives:</span></p><p class="c9"><span class="c1">When building a RC plane the most common kinds of glues that are used are Hot glue/Glue gun glue and Cyanoacrylate glue (CA) like feviquick. Resin based glues can also be used like Araldite but get the 5 minute setting ones. Cello tape is also really useful to reinforce parts of your plane, make it water resistant and fix any broken parts if you crash. Double sided tape by 3M company is good to stick servos to the body of the plane as they hold the servos very strongly but remember to remove the stickers on the surface of the servos and you can use glues like fevibond or feviquick (Cyanoacrylate adhesive) around the of the servo for a little extra adhesion. Zip ties are useful in larger planes to reinforce landing gear, managing all electrical wiring inside the plane, etc. </span></p><p class="c9"><span class="c1">Misc:</span></p><ol class="c0 lst-kix_qu1xyrb59mn9-0 start" start="1"><li class="c2 li-bullet-0"><span>Icecream stick are useful to reinforce parts of you plane, fix and broken parts, mount your motor to your plane body using </span><span>screws</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;and make the linkages for control surfaces of your plane.</span></li><li class="c2 li-bullet-0"><span class="c1">1mm to 1.5mm diameter steel rods are used to make the push rods of you plane that connect the servo arm to the linkages on your control surfaces. I wound&rsquo;t recommend going beyond 1.5mm diameter as cutting the wire becommes really difficult later.</span></li><li class="c2 li-bullet-0"><span class="c1">2mm thick diameter wire is used to make your landing gears as it can handle more weight but it difficult to cut and will require good wire cutters. Landing gear will also require small tires that can be built using foam or you can buy small plastic ones from a store.</span></li><li class="c2 li-bullet-0"><span class="c1">Wooden skewers are used to mount the wing to the body via rubber bands giving which allows for the wing to be removed and stored while commuting to save space.</span></li><li class="c2 li-bullet-0"><span class="c1">Thick rubber bands are used to mount the wing to the body using the wooden skewers this holds the wing strongly and allows for some flexibility to avoid damage during a rough landing.</span></li></ol><p class="c9"><span class="c1">Cost of materials</span></p><p class="c9"><span class="c1">All above materials can cost between Rs 1000 to 2000 for a flight test RC plane ike the Tiny Trainer depending on your local rates and what you might already have at home.</span></p><p class="c9"><span class="c1">Electronics:</span></p><p class="c9"><span class="c1">Electric is the preferred mode of power for a RC plane especially for beginners as fuels like nitro or gas might not be available all the time near you whereas you can charge your battery from you house and various other reasons.</span></p><p class="c9"><span class="c1">The components required to build this plane are:</span></p><ol class="c0 lst-kix_v1ootkfzpqx-0 start" start="1"><li class="c2 li-bullet-0"><span class="c1">Motor: A BLDC (Brushless DC) motor is preferred for good RC planes, drones, cars, etc. BLDC motors have a kV rating which tell how much RPM it can give per Volt applied to it. These motors are usually bought in a set with their respective propeller and ESC to give the optimal performance for example I got a set with a cheap unbranded 2212/10t 1400 kV BLDC motor, 30A rated Simonk ESC and a pair of 1045 (10 inch) propellers.</span></li><li class="c2 li-bullet-0"><span class="c1">ESC: Electronic Speed Controller allows you to control the speed of the motor by varying a PPM (Pulse Width Modulation) signal given by your transmitter receiver. The ESC have a max current rating on them specifying the max limit of current being pulled by the motor and if the motor pulls more current then it will burn the ESC. I got the 30A rated Simonk ESC with a 1400kV motor and 10inch prop but I wouldn&rsquo;t recommend flying on full throttle as this can pull more than 30A of current resulting in the risk of the ESC catching fire. Some precaution I took was limiting the max throttle to 80% in the RC transmitter software, you can also just get an 8inch prop instead of 10inch as it pushing less air and acting as a smaller load on the motor or get a 1000kV motor with a 10inch prop instead of a 1400kV motor as it will have a lower RPM and more torque reducing the current drawn for pushing air.</span></li><li class="c2 li-bullet-0"><span>Battery: RC plane mostly use Lipo batteries as they are light weight and can discharge large abount of current required by the motor to keep the plane in the air. Lipo batteries are dangerous and you should be cautious when handling them. When charging never over charge your batteries and stop charging when the total voltage reaches 4.2V per cell which for a 3S (3 cells connected in series) Lipo will be a total of 12.6V. Always charge you batteries at a low rate of around 1C using a special type of charger called a balance charger (if your battery capacity is 1000mAh then 1C is 1A or if your battery capacity is 2000mAh then 1C is 2A) manufacturers of the battery will have a limit for the maximum charging rate i.e. around 3C but for a longer lifespan 1C is the recommended rate of chagrin your Lipo batteries (i.e. it will take about an hour to fully charge). When discharging (flying your plane) please make sure that the maximum battery discharge rates are much higher than the maximum current that the motor can pull from it and make sure that you don&rsquo;t go below 3.5V per cell as it can damage the battery and reduce it&rsquo;s lifespan. If your battery is puffed up please do not use it and if it is puffed to it&rsquo;s limits you will have to discharge it to 0V and go burry it somewhere as it is non recyclable and &nbsp;can explode on any further use. When flying becareful of crashing as if any sharp object is able to pierce the battery then it will immediately catch on fire because when the packaging of the battery opens up due to cuts or being puffed up it exposes the thin Li sheets inside to air that has oxygen and moisture in it. Li one of the most reactive metals so it reacts with water explosively giving a lilac/purple coloured flame and it is a self sustaining reaction i.e. it can continue to burn in environments without oxygen like under water because the reaction generates oxygen. There are many video of people intensionally causing Lipo batteries to explode to show how dangerous it can be. </span><span class="c7"><a class="c4" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://youtu.be/K6hGvXxFTFA&amp;sa=D&amp;source=editors&amp;ust=1658166355894049&amp;usg=AOvVaw3YgsNOITxy9deWIENGWCEJ">Flite Test : RC Planes for Beginners: Batteries and Safety - Beginner Series - Ep. 7</a></span></li></ol><p class="c6"><span class="c1">In my case I bought a 3S 1000mAh 30C/60C Lipo battery by the Orange brand which is a common and well known brand in india. The 30C is the maximum constant discharge rate of the the battery which means that it can give a maximum constant current of about 30A and 60C is the maximum discontinuos/pulse discharge rate meaning that it can in certain situations give upto 60A for a very short amount of time. This is sufficient for my use case as the motor draws maximum of 15A to 20A on 80% throttle generating 800g of thrust which is much more than required for a 400g to 500g plane to lift off.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c1">Note: When storing your batteries during off season for a long duration make sure that they are always around storage voltage of 3.7V per cell &nbsp;(11.1V total) and never go below 3.5V per cell as even when sitting around batteries lose voltage by discharign through the air slowly and various other reason so please always monitor your battery voltages regularly. Never use a battery which has a voltage of 3.0V or lower per cell as it will start to puff up soon.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c1">PS: I might have scared most people by now but Lithium batteries like Lipo and Lion are use in many electronics and if treated well they work fine and never catch on fire. In case of batteries get a good branded Lipo as with a brand comes reliability and also consider buying a fire proof Lipo safe storage bag for storing you batteries in your house.</span></p><ol class="c0 lst-kix_v1ootkfzpqx-0" start="4"><li class="c2 li-bullet-0"><span class="c1">Battery Charger: The Lipo battery has to be charged using a balance charger that makes sure that all cells in a multicell Lipo battery while charging have almost equal potential differences. I bought a cheap 2S + 3S Lipo battery charger called the IMAX RC B3 pro balance charger from amazon. This charger charges at a constant rate of 0.8A that means for my 1000mAh Lipo battery it will charge at a rate of 0.8C.</span></li></ol><p class="c6"><span class="c1">Note: If you want to get into the hobby for the long run then I would recommend spending more on a better charger that is customizable and allows you to change the rate of charging while displaying the voltage details of your battery on a display.</span></p><ol class="c0 lst-kix_v1ootkfzpqx-0" start="5"><li class="c2 li-bullet-0"><span class="c1">Battery Volatge Checker: monitoring the voltage of your Lipo is extremely important as stated above that is why if you don&rsquo;t have any tool to measure the voltage of your Lipo you should get a Lipo battery Voltage Checker. I got a pair of cheap Lipo voltage checkers from amazon,</span></li><li class="c2 li-bullet-0"><span class="c1">XT60 to T adaptor: In my case the plug of my Lipo and the plug of my ESC were of different types so got myself an adaptor to connect my battery to the ESC. The other alternative was switching the plug on my ESC to XT60 by desoldering it as well but I didn&rsquo;t have a soldering rod with me at the moment.</span></li></ol><p class="c6"><span class="c1">Note: If you don&rsquo;t want to get this adaptor and change the plug on either your ESC or Battery I would tell you to change the ESC plug over the battery plug as during the process of changing the battery plug if you short the battery bymistake it will result in a spark and the Lipo may not be usable again, Plus the XT60 connectors that are are on high discharge Lipo batteries are much better than the T connectors on some ESCs. </span></p><ol class="c0 lst-kix_v1ootkfzpqx-0" start="7"><li class="c2 li-bullet-0"><span class="c1">Servos: Servo motors are used to control the control surfaces of the plane allowing it to maneuver in air about the three axes roll, pitch and yaw. I had a few sg90 9g microservos already with me but Flightt Test recommends using smaller 5g servos. You should still be able to fit 9g servos in the fuselage of the Tiny Trainer plane. In india 9g servos are the most common ones and their prices are also lesser than 5g ones so you can use them if you like.</span></li><li class="c2 li-bullet-0"><span class="c1">Transmitter + Receiver: These allow you to communicated with the plane from a large distance using Radio waves within a legal frequency of operation. The transmitter receiver that I got was the Fly Sky CT-6B 6 channel 2.4 GHz &lt;20dbm computer programmable transmitter receiver. This is the cheapest branded 6 channel transmitter receiver system I could find and it works well for RC planes, quadcopters and cars. This transmitter says it works upto a max range of 500m to 1km within line of sight but you should not be flying above a height of 200m for many reasons that include low visibility and Indian Civil Aviation laws. This transmitter is an old model and requires 8 AA batteries to operate that gives enough power for 7-8 flights that is not too much so If possible do consider upgrading to the newer FS i6 6 channel transmitter models by Fly Sky if you intend to fly for a long time and buy rechargeable AA batteries for you transmitter and a charger as well. This transmitter has 3 mixes allowing support for quadcopters, delta wing aircrafts, flaperon support, etc.</span></li></ol><p class="c9"><span class="c1">Cost of Electronics:</span></p><p class="c9"><span class="c1">The electronic part I used can be bought on websites like Robu.in and amazon.in for a total amount between Rs 6000 to Rs 6300 with half the cost coming from just the transmitter receiver system. Robu.in in a good website that delivers electronics at great prices and fast as well. They also have offers during off seasons or stock clearnaces resulting in discounts on various electronics and kits.</span></p><p class="c9"><span class="c1">Mindset when Flying RC:</span></p><p class="c9"><span class="c1">When building and Flying RC always double check and take necessary precaustions when performing test and flying as crashing is also a huge part of the hobby but because you have built your plane from scratch you have the advantage of knowing how to repair it and there are various sources on the internet to help you do so and keep you in the hobby for a long term.</span></p><p class="c9"><span class="c1">Legal Restrictions:</span></p><p class="c9"><span class="c1">In india few years ago the Civil Aviation department included RC planes under the drone category requiring any RC plane or RC quadcopter weighing more than 2Kg takeoff weight to be registered and will require a license to operate. This plane weighs about 500g or less so it can be flown without any licence withing greenzones i.e. areas more than 5km away from the nearest airport and below a height of 200m as above 200m is considered yellow zone that requires permission to fly in. Pleae do take precautions before flying for example making sure that there is enough open space to clearly fly within line of sight and in case of a crash it should not damage life and property. Having another person beside you can help make sure that you are not distubed while controling the plane in the air as once it is in the air you have to constantly be in control till you land it.</span></p><p class="c9"><span class="c1">Building</span></p><p class="c9"><span>The instruction for building the plane are provided in the flight test video </span><span class="c7"><a class="c4" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://youtu.be/KJWg5HJBGGc&amp;sa=D&amp;source=editors&amp;ust=1658166355896124&amp;usg=AOvVaw3J_rWgWlFGnKuzIcE85t17">Flite Test | Tiny Trainer BUILD</a></span><span class="c1">.

The ice cream stick is stuck to the rudder by cyanoacrylate glue which makes a strong connection which doesn&#39;t flex. There are two holes in the ice-cream stick because the other hole being farther away from the hinge didn&#39;t give enough range of angle given the maximum range of the servo motor and so I had to make another hole much closer to the hinge.</span></p><ol class="c0 lst-kix_kxj6utgvl0kd-0" start="3"><li class="c14 c8 c12 li-bullet-0"><h1 id="h.e4jl0pvw70ts" style="display:inline"><span class="c5"><a class="c4" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://youtu.be/pBJkkFb4-u4&amp;sa=D&amp;source=editors&amp;ust=1658166355897921&amp;usg=AOvVaw0T6lkEmK6BqfmsMqFVOnqF">3S lipo Battery discharge test from 12.2V to 11.4V at 50% throttle</a></span><span class="c3">.</span></h1></li></ol><p class="c6"><span class="c3">Here you can see the seven segment display showing the voltage of each cell of the 3S (1, 2, 3) Lipo as well as overall voltage (ALL). The battery&#39;s voltage at full chage is 12.6V (3x4.2V) and storage voltage is 11.1V (3x3.7V) and it is not recommended to go below 3.6V per cell i.e. 10.8V total as it can damage the battery and shorten it&#39;s lifespan. The propeller pushing the air creates a very high load draining as much as 12A current at 50% power and providing around 400g of thrust (according to internet). It is not recommended to use maximum thrust on a 1400kv motor and 10inch propeller because the current drawn can go more than 30A which is more that the max limit of the ESC so it is recommended to run at 50% to 80% power/throttle max. The battery and motor were cool enough to touch after the test (50% power for about 5 mins) so there should not be any overheating issue at all.</span></p><ol class="c0 lst-kix_kxj6utgvl0kd-0" start="4"><li class="c2 li-bullet-0"><span class="c5"><a class="c4" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://youtu.be/Zyn4P6rqPV8&amp;sa=D&amp;source=editors&amp;ust=1658166355898430&amp;usg=AOvVaw1MUi2ffcHOxhuNfOVRbTqS">Elevator and Rudder testing with sg90 9g servos &amp; added front landing gear</a></span><span class="c3">.</span></li></ol><p class="c6"><span class="c3">Elevator (horizontal) and Rudder (vertical) testing. Both are controlled by a 9g micro servo as shown in my previous rudder test post.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3">I also added landing gear (the red plastic tyres) in front of the fuselage (body) and will most likely add one at the back. Landing gear was compulsory to add in my case because this plane is really heavy (around 500g I guess) for the wing span so it will require a run up on the ground before it reaches a certain velocity to produce more lift than it&#39;s weight. It also has a huge propeller (10 inch diameter) which requires it to be elevated so the blades don&#39;t hit the ground while taking off and landing.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3">I also was regretting using a really dense foam material (A type of foam I got from a local vinyl printing shop) for the body which is at least twice as heavy as of what I needed (extruded polystyrene type). It should be technically possible to fly this so that is why I didn&#39;t want to abandon this structure just at that point of time. If it didn&#39;t work I&#39;ll have to make a lighter/smaller plane or just get some other lightweight material like cardboard, depron, polystyrene, coroplast, etc.</span></p><ol class="c0 lst-kix_kxj6utgvl0kd-0" start="5"><li class="c8 c12 c14 li-bullet-0"><h1 id="h.d5xef7onwj7k" style="display:inline"><span class="c5"><a class="c4" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://youtu.be/yFH43yovQOE&amp;sa=D&amp;source=editors&amp;ust=1658166355899128&amp;usg=AOvVaw2jRz0kpxMInzux2Z4sLEmR">DIY front Landing gear testing</a></span><span class="c3">.</span></h1></li></ol><p class="c8 c10 c12"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c8 c12"><span class="c3">The video didn&#39;t have rear landing gear so it took half throttle just to overcome static friction.

This was done because I didn&rsquo;t want ot buy a Y lead to control both servos to the same channel. The plane is completely done at this point all that is left is to convert the ailerons to flaperon using the remaining 2 mixes. A good thing to do is label the channels each servo has to connect to otherwise you will have to reprogram the channels or check them using trial and error.</span></p><ol class="c0 lst-kix_kxj6utgvl0kd-0" start="7"><li class="c2 li-bullet-0"><span class="c3">DIY FT Tiny Trainer Maiden Flight Test :)</span></li></ol><p class="c6"><span class="c3">Let go of all anxiety and send it because it was not meant for show but meant to fly.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3">To be continued &hellip;</span></p></body></html>
